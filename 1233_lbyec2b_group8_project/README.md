## Enhanced Graphing Calculator App
The Graphing Calculator, developed using MATLAB, is a tool for students, educators, and professionals in all kinds of fields. It offers an interactive platform to create and visualize various mathematical functions dynamically.

The features include graphing a function, line, circle, dot, and plotting a data. The user can also keep their work by saving the graph. This app also allows the user to be creative by making art or draw through the plots that they have created. 

To access the app, download this file and open the GraphingCalculator.mlapp in your MATLAB.
